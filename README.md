# Taxi Game Reinforcement Learning Project

## Overview
The Taxi Game Reinforcement Learning Project is a comprehensive implementation of various reinforcement learning algorithms to solve the Taxi-v3 environment from OpenAI's Gym. This project includes implementations of Q-learning, Monte Carlo, and Deep Q-Network (DQN) algorithms, showcasing their application in a classic control task.

## Features
- Implementation of **Q-learning**: A tabular method for reinforcement learning.
- Implementation of **Monte Carlo**: A method based on averaging sample returns.
- Implementation of **Deep Q-Network (DQN)**: A neural network-based approach to reinforcement learning.
- Visualization of training progress and results.
